My solutions to A Tour of Go exercises

## Compile and Run

### Exercise: Stringers

```
go run stringer.go
```

### Exercise: Readers

```sh
go run reader.go
```

Had to first run:

* `go mod init github.com/dskecse/tour` - created `go.mod`
* `go get golang.org/x/tour/reader` - created `go.sum` and appended to `go.mod`
